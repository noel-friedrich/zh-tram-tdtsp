# Z端rich Tram TD-TSP
> Finding the fastest way to visit all of Z端richs Tram Stations by Tram

## Problem Formulation

I want to visit all Tram Stations in Z端rich in one day, only by Tram. Using public timetables, I try to find optimized paths using different approaches such as Time-Dependant Ant Colony Optimization, Heuristic-Optimized Nearest-Neighbour Searches and more. This problem is a Time-Dependant Travelling-Salesperson-Problem (TD-TSP) and is significantly harder than the 'traditional' TSP, as the introduction of timetables make 'traditional' efficient optimization techniques hard. Since I want paths that are executable in real life, the optimization also includes minimum buffer times and plan-B optimizations.

## Current best path

I have found the best path so far using Ant Colony Optimization (see `main.ipynb`). It has a theoretical length of 9 Hours, 6 Minutes and 18 Seconds and starts in Schlieren, Geissweid. The exact path can be found at `export-paths/ant.2025-01-28--9-06-18.txt`. I tried this path in real life on the 28.01.2025 and missed a few planned connections leading to a **current record of 9 hours and 37 minutes**. Given the opportunity, I dressed up as a travelling salesman. Here is a visualization of the path, it enumerates all stops and provides an additional outline:

## Code Structure

My analysis is done in Jupyter Notebooks, mainly the "main.ipynb". To run the cells, you need to unpack the "2025_google_transit.zip" file and place the contents into a directory called "2025_google_transit". The unpacked files are too large to be hosted on GitHub (>100MB). The notebooks have been tested with python version 3.9.

The files "gt_parsing.py" and "tramnetwork.py" provide basic utilities for creating and loading a TramNetwork object from the google transit files. The google transit files have been downloaded from the following website: https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_fahrplandaten_gtfs.  

### /assets
This directory contains images of Z端richs Tram Network to be used in visualizations later.

### /export-paths
This directory contains saved TramPath objects, which describe a route. The files are generated in a human-readable format and can be parsed by calling `TramPath.load(file_name, network)`, where `network` is an instance of a loaded `TramNetwork`. Every filename contains a name, the date the path starts on and the length of the path in the following format: `<name>.<date>--<length>.txt`.

### /graph-exports
This directory contains precomputed and exported graphs. For example, `graph3.json` contains an export of the entire `TramNetwork` including all connections and precomputed distances on the `28.01.2025`.

### /old-visualizations
This directory contains visualizations of previously created routes. The visualization style is not consistent between files; some contain additional path information.

### /visualizations
This directory contains visualizations of newly generated routes using my new standardised visualization format. The filenames are similar to the files in the `/export-paths` directory.

You may create these visualizations by calling `TramPath.save_image(name: str)` on a TramPath object.
